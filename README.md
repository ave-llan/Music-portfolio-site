Music-portfolio-site
====================

Personal site to show my work as a composer.  
View live here: http://www.johnleszczynski.com
Super simple HTML and CSS for now, but it will evolve. 

Home page generates a new cantus firmus for every visitor using a little javascript program I wrote as well as Vexflow to render the music notation.
