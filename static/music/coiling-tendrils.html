                    Some climbing plants such as cucumbers and passion flowers have a remarkable way of hoisting themselves up towards the sun using coiling tendrils. The plants send threadlike tendrils upwards which swirl around in a blind exploratory motion, the same way we might search in the dark for an overhead light switch pull chain.  When a tendril touches something, it grabs on for support and then something physically changes in the tendril, and it begins to wind itself up. As the tendril coils and gets shorter, it pulls the rest of the plant up with it towards the sunlight, where it uses the extra light to produce more exploratory tendrils and continue the climb.

                    The quartet depicts a plantâ€™s journey upward from the ground into full sunlight.  Just as the plant cannot suddenly leap up to a higher level, nearly all the upward motion in the piece happens step by step.  At the beginning, the plant is quietly putting all its energy into producing the initial tendrils.  Once these are established, they begin whirling around, searching for a foothold. The swirling soprano and alto saxophones eventually grab ahold of something and begin coiling up the tenor and baritone behind them.  From this point, the plant produces more tendrils, and begins searching for an even higher support.   Eventually the tendrils latch onto something and again coil themselves to pull up the heart of the plant.  As the piece ends, the plant is now at its highest position and basks in full sunlight.

                    Rhythmically, the piece is an obsessive exploration of groupings of five.  The phrases are five measures long, the measures are five beats long, and these beats are further divided into quintuplets. Much of the musical development is accomplished by passing motives through the different nested layers of fives so that the same theme becomes faster or slower.
