                The Barkada Saxophone Quartet won the Grand Prize at the Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition performing They Might Be Gods. The US Navy Band premiered and toured the country playing Scherzo a la Britten, which was subsequently performed at the American Bandmasters Association 2013 convention by the University of Georgia Wind Ensemble. Other performances of the piece include those by the wind ensembles of the US Army Field Band, Indiana University, the University of South Florida, the University of Tennessee, and the Atlanta Youth Wind Symphony. In the MBM Times, Dr. Jeffrey D. Gershman named Scherzo one of the best new wind pieces of the year. The Herald Times called it "a mighty ear-stunner ... exhilarating to experience."
